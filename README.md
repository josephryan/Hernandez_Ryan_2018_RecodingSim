# Recoding simulation analyses

### Background
Models of protein evolution or amino acid replacement models are used to score amino acid substitutions in sequence alignments or phylogenetic analyses. The Dayhoff and JTT matrices are examples of 20-state amino acid replacement models. Recently, recoding techniques have been employed to address difficulties that these models have dealing with compositional heterogeneity and substitution saturation (Susko & Roger 2007). Dayhoff recoding (i.e., Dayhoff 6-state recoding) specifically recodes amino acids from Dayhoff matrices according to 6 groups of chemically related amino acids that frequently replace one another (Hrdy et al. 2005), while JTT recoding (i.e., S&R 6-state recoding) is based on binning experiments by Susko & Roger (2007). 

### Rationale
The principle of using recoding to address compositional heterogeneity and substitution saturation has never been extensively tested. Evidence from our analysis presented at the SICB 2018 Conference showed that for all simulated saturated datasets in the study, Dayhoff 6-state recoding performed worse than the PAM250 (Dayhoff) model. These preliminary results raise doubts about the benefits of using recoding approaches. 

### Objectives
The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of 6-state recoding by comparing the performance of analyses on recoded and non-recoded datasets that have been simulated under gradients of compositional heterogeneity or saturation. In addition, we evaluate alternative recoding strategies using 9, 12, 15, and 18 states.
