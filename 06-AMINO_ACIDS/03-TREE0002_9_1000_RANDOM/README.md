# Directory in which to run simulations using tree 0.002, inflation parameter 0.9, and randomly paired starting amino acid frequencies
directory to simulate compositionally heterogeneous datasets using tree 0.002, inflation parameter 0.9, and randomly paired starting amino acid frequencies

### all.out
this file only contains the number 0 and is used to meet the parameter settings since we did not simulate a null distribution for these analyses
