# Scripts to simulate and test compositionally heterogeneous datasets

### comphet.pl
produces compositionally heterogeneous datasets using hypothetical trees 0.008, 0.004, 0.002, and 0.001 (trees available in this repo in 01-MODULES/CompHet.pm)  
to run: 

`perl comphet.pl TREE0008 INFL LENGTH PAIRING NULL.out > pvals.out`  

`INFL` is the inflation parameter, `LENGTH` is the sequence length for simulation, `PAIRING` is the starting amino acid frequency pairings (i.e., alphabetical or random) used by our algorithm to simulate compositional heterogeneity, and `NULL.out` is the null distribution of comp-het indices (produced by using the scripts in 02-COMPOSITIONAL_HETEROGENEITY/01-NULL_DISTRIBUTION in this repo)

### 01-TREE0008.1, 02-TREE0008.5, 03-TREE0008.9, 04-TREE0004.1, 05-TREE0004.5, 06-TREE0004.9, 07-TREE0002.1, 08-TREE0002.5, 09-TREE0002.9, 10-TREE0001.1, 11-TREE0001.5, 12-TREE0001.9
empty directories in which to simulate compositionally heterogeneous datasets

### comphet_index_scatter.R 
produces a scatter plot showing the relationship between the length of internode branches for each tree and comp-het index values for each inflation parameter tested using comphet_index.csv

### comphet_index.csv
com-het index values for each simulated dataset

### chunkify_comphet_trees.pl
recodes simulated datasets using Dayhoff 6-state recoding and S&R 6-state recoding and generates shell scripts for maximum-likelihood analyses in RAxML

### is_mono.pl
scores trees to determine the proportion of incorrect trees that were reconstructed under recoding and non-recoding approaches

to run: 

`perl is_mono.pl MODEL (DAYHOFF OR JTT) > is_mono.out`

### parapruner_is_mono.py
is_mono.pl implements parapruner_is_mono.py to test if trees recovered the two compositionally heterogeneous 10-taxa clades (i.e., a clade containing all A and B taxa and a clade containing all C and D taxa) 

### comphet_bargraph.R 
produces a bar graph showing the percentage of incorrect trees reconstructed under each method, tree used for simulation, and level of compositional heterogeneity (inflation parameter) tested using comp_het_proportion_reconstruction.csv

### comp_het_proportion_reconstruction.csv
proportion of incorrect trees for each phylogenetic reconstruction method, tree used for simulation, and level of compositional heterogeneity

### ztest_proportions_comphet.R 
performs z-tests on the proportions of incorrect trees reconstructed under recoding and non-recoding methods using ztest_comphet_proportions.csv

### ztest_comphet_proportions.csv
number of incorrect trees reconstructed for each phylogenetic method, trees used for simulation, and level of compositional heterogeneity (inflation parameter)
