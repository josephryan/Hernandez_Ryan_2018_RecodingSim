# Directory in which to run simulations using tree 0.002

directory to simulate datasets for null distribution using tree 0.002

### chunkify_comphet_trees.pl
symbolic link for script that recodes simulated datasets using Dayhoff 6-state recoding and S&R 6-state recoding and generates shell scripts for maximum-likelihood analyses in RAxML

### is_mono.pl
symbolic link for script that scores trees to determine the proportion of incorrect trees that were reconstructed under recoding and non-recoding approaches

### tree0.002_bargraph.R
produces a bar graph showing the percentage of incorrect trees reconstructed under each method and level of compositional heterogeneity tested on data simulated over hypothetical tree 0.002 (including simulated data with no added compositional heterogeneity)

### tree0.002_proportions.csv
proportion of incorrect trees for each phylogenetic reconstruction method and level of compositional heterogeneity tested on data simulated over hypothetical tree 0.002
