# Directory in which to run simulations using tree 0.002

empty directory to simulate datasets for null distribution using tree 0.002

### tree0.002_bargraph.R
produces a bar graph showing the percentage of incorrect trees reconstructed under each method and level of compositional heterogeneity tested on data simulated over hypothetical tree 0.002 (including simulated data with no added compositional heterogeneity)

### tree0.002_proportions.csv
proportion of incorrect trees for each phylogenetic reconstruction method and level of compositional heterogeneity tested on data simulated over hypothetical tree 0.002
