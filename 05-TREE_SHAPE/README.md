# Simulations of compositional heterogeneity on an asymmetric tree

### 01-TREE000C_1_1000, 02-TREE000C_5_1000, 03-TREE000C_9_1000 
directories in which to simulate compositionally heterogeneous datasets

### comphet.pl
symbolic link for script that produces compositionally heterogeneous datasets using Chang tree (available in this repo in 01-MODULES/CompHet.pm)

### is_mono.pl
symbolic link for script that scores trees to determine the proportion of incorrect trees that were reconstructed under recoding and non-recoding approaches

`perl is_mono.pl MODEL (DAYHOFF OR JTT) > is_mono.out`
