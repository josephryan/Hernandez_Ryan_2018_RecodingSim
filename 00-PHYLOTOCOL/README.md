# Planned analyses

Phylotocol is a system for documenting a priori, planned phylogenetic analyses, and providing details related to changes to the original protocol through updated versioning.
See the publication (https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/4/672/5267839) and github repo (https://github.com/josephryan/phylotocol) for more info about phylotocol.

Original planned analyses. These did not include analyses of compositional heterogeneity.

# MAIN PHYLOTOCOLS

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.0.pdf
Our analysis did not address compositional heterogeneity and since we used the same model for simulation and testing, we did not consider problems stemming from poor model fit. As such, this phylotocol serves as an extension of our previous phylotocol (phylotocol_recoding_v1.pdf) to address these concerns.

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.1.pdf
Changed the way we will perform simulations and calculations of compositional heterogeneity in section 2.3 of the phylotocol by using straightforward methods in P4 (Foster 2004). 

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.2.pdf
Changed methods in section 2.3 because we could not adequately simulate and test compositional heterogeneity. We have changed the tree we will use for simulations and the method we will use to evaluate tree reconstructions.

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.3.pdf
We added methods under section 2.3.7 to test for statistical significance of results from 2.3.6. We also added section 2.4 to test alternative Dayhoff recoding strategies.

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.4.pdf
We added additional analyses in sections 2.5-2.9 after receiving comments from reviewers through our submission to *Systematic Biology*. We also updated the language in section 2.3.1 for clarity of methods.

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.5.pdf
After consulting with several scientists about the proposed statistics in section 2.9 in the previous version of our phylotocol, we are making necessary corrections in section 3.1. We are also adding additional analyses under sections 3.2-3.3 to further explore our results after completing analyses from sections 2.5-2.8. 

### phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.5.1.pdf
We updated our phylotocol with the appropriate commands to perform analyses in sections 2.6-2.8 and 3.2.
